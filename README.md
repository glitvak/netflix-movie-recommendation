# netflix-movie-recommendation
a very basic recommendation system using python(pandas, sklearn) on a netflix database I found on kaggle

IF USING OUTSIDE OF KAGGLE:
make sure to configure the first two code boxes for retrieving the csv file off your own medium rather than getting it off of kaggle's directory.
